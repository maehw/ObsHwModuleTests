# OBS GPS module test jig

I've made a tiny test jig with pogo pins for u-blox NEO-6M modules in TinkerCad that can be 3D-printed.

This is what it looks like:

You slide the GPS module in on top and connect it via with a USB/serial converter cable to a Windows PC. You can then use the [u-blox u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center?lang=de) GNSS evaluation software for Windows to test the module.

Please note that the current version (Rev2) will need support when being printed with a regular 3D printer.

You can download the `.stl` file here:
